### Instructions from Karen:
- Get best prediction
  - Try different complexity of models
- What is most important factors
  - ranking
    - split by total and by KWH and NG
- How can we reduce energy consumption
- Constrained optimization (given some factors that can't change how can we optimize energy consumption)

## Abstract
Understanding the nation's energy usage patterns is critical to building a sustainable infrastructure. Identifying areas of waste and opportunities to implement resource-saving practices could drastically reduce the cost of various energy types. In our analysis, we will look at the profiles of approximately 5,000 households to identify patterns related to the usage of electriciy and natural gas. From this data, we will recommend ways homeowners and landlords can reduce energy consumption. Additionally, we'll examine the feasability of predicting energy consumption given information about a household.

## Introduction
Energy usage in US households consists primarily of electricity and natural gas, but the usage of these resources varies significantly.

## Method and Result

### Data Preparation
#### Removing Columns
#### Filling in Data

### Feature Selection
How much energy a household uses is a complex matter: it is determined by many variables. We want to identify which aspects of the homes and the homeowners contribute the most to their energy use. By focusing our efforts on the most impactful factors, we can identify which changes could potentially yield the best results.

#### Recursive Feature Elimination
Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is a method of identifying the most valuable features by building many models with all the variables and removing those that have little reduction to the total error. Running this method on our input data, we can see that there are several key features that explain much of the variance, and that a majority of the features contribute only a little. We used 10-fold validation on RFE to avoid over-fitting our results.

And now if we zoom in, we can see our most useful variables:

![Top Features](impactful_variables.png)

| Variable | Description                                       | Root Mean Squared Error |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------: |
| NHSLDMEM | Number that live in the household                 | 0.1035                  |
| TYPEHUQ  | Type of home (e.g. single-family, apartment, etc) | 0.2412                  |
| HD65     | Number of hot days                                | 0.3515                  |
| TOTHSQFT | Total home square feet                            | 0.3958                  |
| TOTSQFT  | Total square feet                                 | 0.4165                  |
| LRGSTATE | Is a large state (i.e. CA, FL, OR, TX)            | 0.4151                  |

Our results show that the number of household members contributed the most to reducing the error in our model. This is likely due to the more frequent usage of appliances by household members. Additionally, with more people living in the hosehold, there's more likely at least one person home requiring heating or cooling.

#### Principle Component Analysis
Another way to understand the impact our variables have on energy usage is to examine how the variables interact with each other. We can do this through Principle Component Analysis (PCA). With PCA we convert the variables into Principle Components. These components are a weighted combination of many variables, which captures the interplay amongst these variables. They are arranged by how much each component contributes to the variance.

So, principle component 1 (PC1) explains the most about our energy usage, PC2 the second most, and so on. We can see in the graph below that our most explanatory component (PC1) is square footage, and it's opposite is the type of home (TYPEHUQ), with higher category number typically denoting smaller home types (e.g. apartments). This finding is intuitive. Larger homes take more energy to regulate temperature, and smaller homes require less.

Principle Component 2 (PC2), however, reveals an interesting finding. It appears that older persons tend to use less energy. We can see that the older the primary owner is (AGEHHMEM1) and if they are in retirement (RETIREPY) as associated with less energy consumption. And on the flip side we see that those who are working (WORKPAY) and have more people at home (NHSLDMEM) (e.g. young families) use more energy. One hypothesis is that older persons are more experienced with home ownership. They have more years of home ownership and have thus optimized the heating/cooling of their homes to reduce costs. An alternative, and perhaps better supported hypothesis, is that older people tend to live alone or with fewer people. This hypothesis is not only supported by the PCA, but it was found that the number of household members (NHSLDMEM) was our strongest single feature found in RFE.

## Conclusion and Further Work


## Takeaways
This project did a great job of demonstrating the reality of real world datasets compared to the preprocessed examples that students are accustomed to working with. Real data sets are messy. Real data sets don't always have that one obvious correlation. There is a lot of noise and a lot of missing data. Given this new perspective, we will allocate more time to understanding the variables and dealing with missing values.

Another thing that we would do differently on future projects is to spend more time on gathering client requirements. We charged gung ho ahead with our new-found data mining skills and spent significant time implementing many of the techniques only to realize they might not be very useful given our client's requirements. After having a brief discussion with the client to clarify expectations, we had a well defined plan of action. Doing this earlier would have saved us considerable time.




This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
